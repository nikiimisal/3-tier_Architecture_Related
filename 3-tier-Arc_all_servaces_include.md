I have practiced all the individual components up to this point. Now, my plan is to consolidate these topics into a complete three‑tier architecture, consisting of the following layers:

1. Database Tier (DB Tier): A relational database, such as RDS, hosting the data used by the application.

2. Application Tier (App Tier): Application servers (e.g., written in PHP or another language) that implement the business logic and connect to the RDS endpoint.

3. Web Tier: Web servers that serve the front-end (HTML, UI). These servers forward dynamic requests to the application tier.

4. Internet‑Facing Load Balancer: A public-facing load balancer that distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple web-tier servers.

Implementation Steps:

On the application tier, configure the code (e.g., in PHP) with the RDS endpoint to connect to the database.

Deploy this application code into the web-tier servers (e.g., within the HTML or code directory of the web server).

Establish an internet‑facing load balancer to receive user traffic and forward it to the web-tier servers.
